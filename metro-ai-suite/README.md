The Metro AI Suite accelerates application development for sophisticated edge AI video safety, security, and smart city use cases.

The Metro AI Suite includes Intel® software such as OpenVINO&trade; toolkit, Deep Learning Streamer, Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkit, and other tools, libraries, and microservices for media analytics and AI performance optimization for the abovementioned use cases.  

The Suite includes the following tools and tookits:
- [Metro AI Suite SDK](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=metro-ai-suite-sdk-for-software-developers): Provides a comprehensive and modular toolkit for accelerated media processing and AI inference, designed to fast-track the development of visual AI solutions.
- [Visual Pipeline and Performance Evaluation Tool](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/tools/visual-pipeline-and-platform-evaluation-tool): Assess Intel® hardware options, benchmark performance, and analyze key metrics to optimize hardware selection for AI workloads.
- [Device qualification tool](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=metro-ai-suite-device-qualification-for-hardware-builder) For device and equipment manufacturers, the suite includes a device qualification tool to verify and benchmark hardware performance and create system qualification reports. See [recommended hardware catalog](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/edge-5g/edge-solutions/hardware.html) for a list of qualified system configurations.


The Suite also provides a collection of visual analytics sample applications, using deep learning and large models (generative AI):
- [Loitering Detection](metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/loitering-detection): Effortlessly monitor and manage areas with AI-driven video analytics for real-time insights and enhanced security
- [Smart Parking](metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/smart-parking/): Effortlessly manage parking spaces with AI-driven video analytics for real-time insights and enhanced efficiency.
- [Smart Intersection](metro-vision-ai-app-recipe/smart-intersection): Combines analytics from multiple traffic cameras to provide a unified intersection view, enabling object tracking across multiple viewpoints, motion vector analysis (e.g., speed and heading), and understanding object interactions in three-dimensional space.
- [Smart NVR](smart-nvr): Integrates generative AI-powered vision analytics to a Network Video Recorder (NVR) and delivers advanced event detection, summarization, and automation while reducing bandwidth and storage requirements by processing and analyzing video data directly at the edge.
- [Video Processing for NVR](video-processing-for-nvr): A sample application based on Video Processing Platform SDK that allows users to evaluate and optimize video processing workflows for NVR.
- [Image Search by Text](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/details/?microserviceType=recipe&microserviceNameForUrl=metro-ai-suite-image-search-by-text): A reference implementation using multi-modal large language models to perform image search with text query.
- [Image Based Video Search](image-based-video-search): Performs near real-time analysis and image-based search to detect and retrieve objects of interest in large video datasets.
- [Visual Search Question and Answering](visual-search-question-and-answering): A unified application that integrates a multi-modal search engine for image search with text query with a visual question and answering assistant.
